# What is an Outlier?

An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. In a sense, this definition leaves it up to the analyst (or a consensus process) to decide what will be considered abnormal. Before abnormal observations can be singled out, it is necessary to characterize normal observations.

# How does outlier impact the prediction?

 Outlier Affect on variance, and standard deviation of a data distribution. In a data distribution, with extreme outliers, the distribution is skewed in the direction of the outliers which makes it difficult to analyze the data.And hence the prediciton.
 
# How to detect an Outlier?

As mentioned above , an outlier is a data point stands out from the usual crowd. So many at times one can detect one simply by seeing the visualizations.
And when it's not possible to see from the naked eye, we perform mathematical tricks for the same.These techniques/ tricks are mentioned below.

# Simple Ways discussed for detecting outlier.
   
    1.Percentile
    
    2.Scatter Plot
    
    3.By using 3 Standard Deviation
    
    4.With the help of Z test
